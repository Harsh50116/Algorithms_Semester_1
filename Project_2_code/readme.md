We are given a set P of n points in a two-dimensional plan, and we want to compute the convex hull of P. The convex hull is defined as the smallest convex polygon containing the points. (A way to visualize a convex hull is to imagine nails on all the points of the plane and put an elastic band around the points â€“ the shape of the elastic band is the convex hull.)
